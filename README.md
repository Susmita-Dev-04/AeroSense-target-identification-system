# 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a real-time machine learning framework for airborne target classification using kinematic data obtained from coastal surveillance radar systems. The system processes trajectory-based motion parameters such as height, resultant velocity, resultant acceleration, and Automatic Gain Control (AGC) to classify airborne targets into multiple aircraft categories.

The framework integrates:
- Real-time UDP socket communication
- Sliding-window time-series feature extraction
- Statistical and temporal feature engineering
- Machine learning classification
- Interactive Streamlit-based visualization dashboard

The proposed system is capable of identifying multiple aircraft classes with high accuracy and low prediction latency, making it suitable for defense surveillance and operational radar environments.
